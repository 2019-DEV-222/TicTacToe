Game Rules:
* X always goes first.

* Players cannot play on a played position.

* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

  * One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

  * All nine squares are filled.

* If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

* If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
